## Azure Container Service (AKS) - Running a Damn Vulnerable Web Application on AKS

This is a follow up from a previous post , where you can set up a Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA from now on) to test the [Azure WAF to protect your Web Application] (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ukhybridcloud/2018/03/20/azure-waf-to-protect-your-web-application)
Now, I would like to run the DVWA within a container using the Azure Container Service (AKS), where Azure manages your hosted Kubernetes environment
